Error criteria :  GINI , entropy 



Completed implementing basic struchure checked with small dataset needs more polish in struchure and complexity as well


Implement : predict and tostirng for checking

assert checking and edge case validations 

Functions:(hella complex method)

	find_best_feature : [ feature , value ]

	find_best_split : [value,err] 

	gini_calc_node : gini value for that node

	gini_for_split : gini impurity for split
